        <h2>Port of Djupvik</h2>
        <p>
          The Port of Djupvik is located on the east coast of Gotland very close
          to the beautiful smaller island Lilla Karlsö. Adjacent to the port is
          a small and charming fishing-village which, during summer, comes to
          life with a relaxed and welcoming buzz.
        </p>

        <p>
          Close by and situated with a fantastic view over the port is Djupvik
          Hotel, with modern standard and with its own popular restaurant.
        </p>

        <p>
          Both the port and the fishing village have a beautiful view of two
          popular bird islands called “Lilla Karlsö” and “Stora Karlsö”.
        </p>

        <p>
          The coastline south of Djupvik, called “Ekstakusten” is incredibly
          beautiful and invites to nice scenery and views on foot, by bike or by
          car. <br />
        </p>

        <p>
          North, and connected to the port, is a small sandy beach which is well
          soothed for a nice swim.
        </p>

        <p>
          The distance from the port to Lilla Karlsö is about 2 nautical miles
          and it is about twice as long to Stora Karlsö (4nm).
